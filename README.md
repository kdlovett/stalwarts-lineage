## How to play
Survive the onslaught of the Moorlord long enough to obtain three floating skulls. Legend has it, once an individual obtains three of these mysterious skulls, safe passage beyond the swamp will reveal itself. Manage your ammunition, and the condition of the boat, by obtaining more ammunition and repair kits from the great eagle Huron, who will occassionally sweep past the ship. The more damage sustained by the Moorlord and the skull shamans attempting to restore his vitality, the longer you'll have before he arrives again.

## Controls
Control the ship's cannon with "W" and "S". Fire the ship's cannon with "A". Attempt to catch a skull with "E". Attempt to lure Huron with "F". Repair the ship with "D". (Will temporarily slow the cannon's rate of fire.)
